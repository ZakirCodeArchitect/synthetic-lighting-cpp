# Synthetic Lighting for Photography ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’¡

## Overview  
This project is an **image processing assignment** for CS 423 (Computer Graphics). The goal is to manipulate images by modifying lighting conditions using **C++**. The project involves **reading and writing .ppm images**, **extracting individual light contributions**, **applying negative lighting**, **creating grayscale images**, and **morphing between two images** using weighted averaging.

## Features  
âœ… Read and write `.ppm` image files  
âœ… Extract and modify light contributions  
âœ… Change the color of light sources  
âœ… Generate **negative images**  
âœ… Convert images to **grayscale**  
âœ… Create **morphing sequences** between two images  
âœ… Save processed images for visualization  

## Getting Started ðŸš€  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have:  
- A **C++ compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)  
- A **PPM viewer** like [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com)  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/synthetic-lighting-cpp.git
   cd synthetic-lighting-cpp
